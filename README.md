# 🚗 Used Car Price Prediction with Linear Regression  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project focuses on **predicting the price of used cars** based on various features such as **mileage, year, transmission type, color, and model**. Using **linear regression** (with and without regularization), the project demonstrates:  
- Feature engineering with categorical and numerical data  
- Encoding categorical features (One-Hot Encoding, manual mapping)  
- Feature scaling with **StandardScaler**  
- Model training using **LinearRegression** and **Ridge Regression**  
- Model evaluation using **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**  
- Visualization of regression results and feature importance  
- Prediction of car prices for new unseen data

## ⚙️ Features Implemented  
- 📉 **Mileage vs Price** regression analysis  
- 📆 **Year vs Price** regression analysis  
- ⚙️ **Categorical features** handled with encoding:  
  - Transmission (Auto/Manual)  
  - Color  
  - Model  
- 🔄 **Feature scaling** for better model performance  
- 🏋️ **Regularized regression (Ridge)** for improved generalization  
- 📊 Visualizations:  
  - Regression fit vs. actual values  
  - Feature importance (weights)  
- 🚘 **Predict price of a new car** based on input parameters
